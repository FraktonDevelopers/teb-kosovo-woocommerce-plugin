Please make sure that you use the right settings provided for your Merchant Account in order to make the plugin work 
properly.

Below is a description of each setting:

#### General
<code>Title</code> - This will appear in your payment provider list in frontend.<br>

<code>Currency</code> - Possible values are â‚¬ and $. These two determine the currency you merchant is set up.<br>

#### Security 
This part of settings is highly recommended and please always use this setting.

<code>Whitelisted IP's</code> - This contains the list of IP's that are allowed to send callback requests to your shop. Each
callback determines if the payment transaction went successfully or not. So, this need to be protected by allowing only the IP's provided

won't work.
